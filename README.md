# Introduction
Datafied's data analytics practice project using dataset from a pharmaceutical store.

# Problem Statement

Mary, a pharmaceutical store owner is hoping to imporve her store's drug sales which has stagnanted over a period of time. She has contracted Datafied to help provide insights as to why this has been the case and how she can improve the situation. She has also provided her sales data over the past 6 years from her point-of-sale, which includes information on the date and time of each sale, the name of the pharmaceutical drug sold, and the quantity of each drug sold. From this data provided, the following business questions have been developed to help with analysis:
1. What is the overall average sales of drugs per drug class for the past 6 years?
2. What drug catergory contributes to the highest sale?
3. What drug category contributes to the lowest sale?
4. For each drug catergory, what period(s) record the highest sales?
5. Are there seasonal pattern to drug sales? What periods records the highest sales per year?

   # Data Sourcing
   Data source was obtained from the point-of-sale system, presented as a csv file which I downloaded into an excel file for inspection.
